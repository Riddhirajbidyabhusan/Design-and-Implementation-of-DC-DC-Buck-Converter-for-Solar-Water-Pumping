# Design-and-Implementation-of-DC-DC-Buck-Converter-for-Solar-Water-Pumping
Developed a 20 kHz buck converter to step down 24 V PV supply to 12 V/15.5 A for a 187 W DC pump using
MATLAB/Simulink.
– Achieved >90 percent efficiency with controlled current and voltage ripple.
– Optimized component selection (MOSFET, Schottky diode, inductor, capacitor) and analyzed PV system losses.
– Proposed a low-cost converter for a full solar pumping solution, enabling affordable and sustainable irrigation
